FlashCarp
===========================

A proof-of-concept project to explore a flashcard system for knowledge that are more complex than a single answer to a single question.

*Still in progress!*

Features
--------
#Add multiple answers to one topic/question.
Example Use Case:
```
What are the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution?

1) Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Petition
2) Right to keep and bear arms
3) Conditions for quarters of soldiers
4) Right of search and seizure regulated
5) Provisons concerning prosecution
6) Right to a speedy trial, witnesses, etc.
7) Right to a trial by jury
8) Excessive bail, cruel punishment
9) Rule of construction of Constitution
10) Rights of the States under Constitution

```


#Review cards front and back, as well as sideway by labels.
Each answer is labelled, whether by a simple number or with a more descriptive word like "Name" or "Year".
Example Use Case:
```
Assume that you have a card set about historical events with a bunch of labelled information (date, location, description of event, people, historical impact). If you want to focus on studying just the dates and locations of all these historical events, then you should be able to select for the specific labels you want to study and filter out all others answers.

```



TODO
- Improve editing UX
- Add collections for cardsets
- Add grade report and statistics for correct/incorrect answers
- Add extra rounds for reviewing incorrect answers
